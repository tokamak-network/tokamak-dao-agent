# Inflation Model

## Overview

Tokamak Network uses a seigniorage-based inflation model to reward stakers.

## Seigniorage Mechanism

- New TON is minted as block rewards
- Minted tokens are distributed to stakers
- Inflation rate is adjustable through governance

## Current Parameters

- Base inflation rate: Governed by SeigManager
- Distribution: Proportional to staked amount

## Governance Control

The DAO can vote to adjust:
- Inflation rate
- Distribution mechanisms
- Reward parameters
