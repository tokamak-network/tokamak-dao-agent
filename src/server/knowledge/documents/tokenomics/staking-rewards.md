# Staking Rewards

## Overview

Stakers earn rewards through the seigniorage mechanism in Tokamak Network.

## How Staking Works

1. Convert TON to WTON
2. Stake WTON to a Layer 2 operator
3. Earn seigniorage rewards proportionally

## Reward Calculation

Rewards are calculated based on:
- Amount of WTON staked
- Total WTON staked in the network
- Current seigniorage rate
- Duration of staking

## Reward Distribution

- Rewards accrue in real-time
- Can be claimed at any time
- Compound by re-staking rewards
