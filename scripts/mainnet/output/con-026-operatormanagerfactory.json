Library for reading and writing primitive types to specific storage slots.\\n *\\n * Storage slots are often used to avoid storage conflict when dealing with upgradeable contracts.\\n * This library helps with reading and writing to such slots without the need for inline assembly.\\n *\\n * The functions in this library return Slot structs that contain a `value` member that can be used to read or write.\\n *\\n * Example usage to set ERC1967 implementation slot:\\n * ```solidity\\n * contract ERC1967 {\\n *     bytes32 internal constant _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT =
